This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML/JavaScript programming: attempting to manipulate the DOM before the page has fully loaded. The bug.html file shows the incorrect implementation, leading to a null pointer exception. The solution.html file shows a corrected version using the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the element exists before manipulation.  The solution is simple and efficient, demonstrating the importance of understanding DOM loading timing.
